Notes
-------
- The linear series of commits in a repo is called a branch. The default branch that is created with every new repo is called 'main' (formerly called 'master').
- Git allows users to create branches other than the default one for exploring multiple different sequences of edits in perallel. 
- A merge is when changes from one branch are combined into another branch.
- A pull request is a request to merge changes from a non-default branch (user generated) into the default branch ('main').

4) Go the the 'Insights' page and view the network graph. 
5) Start a pull request for the 'unicorn' branch. Merge the branch. 
6) Go to the network graph and note the difference.
7) Create another branch 'ponies' and edit the poem.txt file. Commit these changes.
