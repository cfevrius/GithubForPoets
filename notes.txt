Notes
-------
- The linear series of commits in a repo is called a branch. The default branch that is created with every new repo is called 'main' (formerly called 'master').
- Git allows users to create branches other than the default one for exploring multiple different sequences of edits in perallel. 
- A merge is when changes from one branch are combined into another branch.
- A pull request is a request to merge changes from a non-default branch (user generated) into the default branch ('main').

Tutorial
---------
1) Create a new branch called 'unicorn'.
2) Edit the 'poem.txt' file and commit to the unicorn branch.
3) Switch back and forth between the 'main' branch and the 'unicorn' and compare the differences between the files.
4) Go the the 'Insights' page and view the network graph. 
5) Start a pull request for the 'unicorn' branch. Merge the branch.
